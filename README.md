# SoulChaser
This repository contains the complete graphic design concept for SoulChaser, an original 2D open-world action game developed as part of a graphic design thesis. The project includes concept art, UI/UX designs, character symbols, map design, visual identity, and a detailed Look Book.

Set in a fictional city inspired by Seoul, SoulChaser features a story-driven experience centered around magical tattoos, gang dynamics, and cultural depth. The visual assets are crafted to support an immersive game world aimed at fans of video games and Asian culture.
